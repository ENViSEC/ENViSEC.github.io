High Performance Computing platform of Kristiania University College!
======================================================================
Welcome to HPC cluster of Kristiania! 

The High Performance Computing (HPC) platform at Kristiania University College (Kristiania Hoyskole)
provides students and researchers with the resources they need to conduct complex experiments in 
science, engineering and mathematics. High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments provide significant 
computational power for scientific and data-intensive tasks. Slurm is a popular job scheduler used 
to efficiently manage and distribute computing resources on an HPC cluster. 
This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with HPC usage using Slurm.
