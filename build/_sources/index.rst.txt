High Performance Computing platform of Kristiania University College!
======================================================================
Welcome to HPC cluster of Kristiania! 

The High Performance Computing (HPC) platform at Kristiania University 
College provides students and researchers with the resources they need 
to conduct complex experiments in science, engineering and mathematics. 
HPC environments provide significant computational power for scientific 
and data-intensive tasks. 
Slurm is a popular job scheduler used to efficiently manage and 
distribute computing resources on an HPC cluster. 
This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with 
HPC usage using Slurm.
