Getting Started Guide:
------------------------

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Access to an HPC cluster with Slurm installed.
- Basic knowledge of Linux command-line operations.
  

Slurm scheduler:
----------------
Slurm operates on the concept of jobs, nodes, and partitions. Familiarize yourself with these key terms:

- **Job**: A computational task submitted to the cluster.
- **Node**: A computing resource that performs tasks as part of a job.
- **Partition**: A logical division of the cluster resources.

Connecting to the HPC Cluster
------------------------------

Use SSH to connect to the HPC cluster:


ssh username@hpc-cluster.example.com

Replace username with your username and hpc-cluster.example.com with the actual address of your HPC cluster.

To submit a job using the `sbatch` command followed by the script file
   
sbatch script.sh
The `script.sh` is the name of your shell script which contains the commands for your job.
The output will provide a unique job ID (e.g., 12345678). You can view more information about
your job using the `squeue` command::

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   def main():
       """The main function."""
       print("Hello, World!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
